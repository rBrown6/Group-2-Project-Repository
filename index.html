		<h2>Group 2's Mission</h2>
			<h3>Hello and welcome to the home page of Group 2! We've dedicated this project to determining which programming language is the most valuable. Within this undertaking, we've come to recognize that the answer to this question is highly subjective and will likely merit a mulitude of diverse responses, each being just as relevant as the next. To many people, terms like "Programming" or "Software Development" simply mean web development. The reality, though, is that many professionals find uses for programming in applications well outside of this scope. Below, we've provided a few examples for the various uses of programming.<br><br></h3>  
            <h3>Why learn a programming language?</h3>                    
          		<p><strong>Is your goal as a programmer to create vivid and responsive webpages?<br></strong>
                    - Javascript is likely the choice for you.<br><br>
             		<strong> Are you more interested in interacting with database management systems?<br></strong>
                    - You're likely better off learning structured query language.<br><br>
             		<strong> Does your work require you to maintain antiquated but otherwise irreplaceable software still in use with banks and other financial institutions?<br></strong>
                    - It sounds like you may need to have a working knowledge of COBOL.<br><br>
             		<strong> Is the only reason you're even bothered to learn programming so that you can automate your work load?<br></strong>
                    - Maybe you should take a look at Python.                   
				<p><strong>As evidenced by the examples above, we can see that there are several different reasons that someone may opt to employ a programming language, and for very different uses. </strong></p>
