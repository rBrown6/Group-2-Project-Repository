<h1>Group 2 Plan
    
<h2>PART I. Let's have everyone on our team pick a software language and provide content which answer the following questions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>1. What software language do you believe is the best, most crucial, most important now in 2022 and going forward?</li>
<li>2. What is this language used for?</li>
<li>3. Why did you choose it?</li>
<li>4. Prepare a web page on this language which outlines your answers to the questions above</li>
<li>5. Use the group project report to demonstrate your software language's particular capabilities. For example:
    <ul>
    <li>HTML - The person who chooses HTML (although not a real language) could build the web page template for our report</li>
    <li>CSS - The person who chooses CSS can style the web report</li>
    <li>JavaScript - The person who chooses JavaScript could think of a way to present the content in an interactive way such as building a caculator which tells people which software language is best for them to learn (see article below)</li>
    <li>SQL - This person could present the information we provide as data in a database format</li>
    <li>ETC. </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>HAMID: PYTHON</li>
<li>RICKY: HTML</li>
