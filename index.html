	<h2>Group 2's Mission</h2>
		<h3>Hello and welcome to the homepage of Group 2! We've dedicated this project to determining which programming language is the most valuable. Within this undertaking, we've come to recognize that the answer to this question is highly subjective and will likely merit a mulitude of different responses, each being just as relevant as the next. To many people, terms like "Programming" or "Software Development" simply mean web development. The reality, though, is that many professionals find uses for programming in applications well outside of this scope. Below, we've provided a few examples for the various uses of programming.<br><br></h3>  
            	<h3>Why learn a programming language?</h3>                    
          		<p><strong>Is your goal as a programmer to create vivid and responsive webpages?<br></strong>
                    - Javascript is likely the choice for you.<br><br>
             		<strong> Are you more interested in interacting with database management systems?<br></strong>
                    - You're likely better off learning structured query language.<br><br>
             		<strong> Does your work require you to maintain antiquated but otherwise irreplaceable software still in use with banks and other financial institutions?<br></strong>
                    - It sounds like you may need to have a working knowledge of COBOL.<br><br>
             		<strong> Is the only reason you're even bothered to learn programming so that you can automate your work load?<br></strong>
                    - Maybe you should take a look at Python.                   
		<p><strong>As evidenced by the examples above, we can see that there are several different reasons that someone may opt to employ a programming language, and for very different uses. </strong></p>

		<h3>Mimi's Favorite Language: SQL</h3>
		<h4>What this language is used for:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Database management</li> 
		<li>Sales reports</li> 
		<li>Business management</li>
		</ul>

		<p>According to Berkley Extension, SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language that allows programmers to query and manipulate databases. As a domain-specific language, it is designed mainly for managing data within an RDBMS (relational database management system). Put simply, SQL can locate and retrieve data from a database, as well as update, add or remove records.</p>
		<p>While SQL is highly functional, it tends to work better with small databases and doesnâ€™t always lend itself to managing expansive ones.</p> 
		<p>That said, SQL still ranks as the third-most-used language in the programming industry, with over half (54.7%) of surveyed developers reporting that they use it.</p>
	<h4>Mimi's Input</h4>
	<p>With the growth of Information Technology, the volume of data produced each day is astonishing. You could say we are overwhelmed with data. And, what good is that data unless we can manage it and manipulate it and understand it? SQL helps us do just that.</p>
