	<h2>Group 2's Mission</h2>
		<h3>Hello and welcome to the homepage of Group 2! We've dedicated this project to determining which programming language is the most valuable. Within this undertaking, we've come to recognize that the answer to this question is highly subjective and will likely merit a mulitude of different responses, each being just as relevant as the next. To many people, terms like "Programming" or "Software Development" simply mean web development. The reality, though, is that many professionals find uses for programming in applications well outside of this scope. Below, we've provided a few examples for the various uses of programming.<br><br></h3>  
            	<h3>Why learn a programming language?</h3>                    
          		<p><strong>Is your goal as a programmer to create vivid and responsive webpages?<br></strong>
                    - Javascript is likely the choice for you.<br><br>
             		<strong> Are you more interested in interacting with database management systems?<br></strong>
                    - You're likely better off learning structured query language.<br><br>
             		<strong> Does your work require you to maintain antiquated but otherwise irreplaceable software still in use with banks and other financial institutions?<br></strong>
                    - It sounds like you may need to have a working knowledge of COBOL.<br><br>
             		<strong> Is the only reason you're even bothered to learn programming so that you can automate your work load?<br></strong>
                    - Maybe you should take a look at Python.                   
		<p><strong>As evidenced by the examples above, we can see that there are several different reasons that someone may opt to employ a programming language, and for very different uses. </strong></p>

		<h3>Ricky's Choice</h3>
		<p>	
			HTML, while not technically a programming language, is a crucial element to any web-based project and is often the first step of the journey to learning programming. Generally put, HTML is used to build the basic structure of the webpage/application. It works in conjunction with programming languages as well as CSS to provide the structure and flow of your webpage, as well as guide its functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
		Like stated before, HTML itself does not pass as a programming language on its own. This is because it does not unilaterally perform tasks central to programming, such as creating If/Else statements, declaring variables, writing functions, modifying data or producing output to name a few. Instead, HTML will provide the foundation of the interface used to complete many of these tasks.<br><br> A few examples of these:
			 <form>
  			<label><strong>Text/Input box:</strong> HTML elements can be utilized to take the input for an embedded scripting function.</label><br>
  			<input type="text" placeholder="Enter Text Here..."><br><br>
            <label><strong>Submit Buttons:</strong> The function of HTML buttons can be assigned action with a JS function, using the OnClick functionality for example.</label><br>
            <input type="submit"><br><br>
            <label><strong>Radio Buttons:</strong> With radio buttons, a language like JavaScript can utilize the associated values to perform a function.</label><br>
            <input type="radio">
 		  </form>
			</p>
            <p>
			

			In the examples above, we can see that while the HTML elements themselves are not responsible for the programming logic that is occurring, their use is still central to the task being performed. It would not be possible for the programmer who created this code to not have at least a working knowledge of HTML in order to employ their programming script.

		<h3>Mimi's Favorite Language: SQL</h3>
		<h4>What this language is used for:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Database management</li> 
		<li>Sales reports</li> 
		<li>Business management</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>According to Berkley Extension, SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language that allows programmers to query and manipulate databases. As a domain-specific language, it is designed mainly for managing data within an RDBMS (relational database management system). Put simply, SQL can locate and retrieve data from a database, as well as update, add or remove records.</p>
		<p>While SQL is highly functional, it tends to work better with small databases and doesnâ€™t always lend itself to managing expansive ones.</p> 
		<p>That said, SQL still ranks as the third-most-used language in the programming industry, with over half (54.7%) of surveyed developers reporting that they use it.</p>
		<h4>Mimi's Input</h4>
		<p>With the growth of Information Technology, the volume of data produced each day is astonishing. You could say we are overwhelmed with data. And, what good is that data unless we can manage it and manipulate it and understand it? SQL helps us do just that.</p>

        <h4>What this language is used for:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li></li>

        </ul>
		<p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>

        <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
            
        <p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>
