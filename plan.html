PART I. Let's have everyone on our team pick a software language and provide content which answer the following questions:

1. What software language do you believe is the best, most crucial, most important now in 2022 and going forward?
2. What is this language used for?
3. Why did you choose it?
4. Prepare a web page on this language which outlines your answers to the questions above
5. Use the group project report to demonstrate your software language's particular capabilities. For example:
    - HTML - The person who chooses HTML (although not a real language) could build the web page template for our report
    - CSS - The person who chooses CSS can style the web report
    - JavaScript - The person who chooses JavaScript could think of a way to present the content in an interactive way such as building a caculator which tells people which software language is best for them to learn (see article below)
    - SQL - This person could present the information we provide as data in a database format
    - ETC.
